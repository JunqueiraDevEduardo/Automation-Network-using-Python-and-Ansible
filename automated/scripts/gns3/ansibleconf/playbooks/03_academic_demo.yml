          ACADEMIC NETWORK AUTOMATION DEMO
          ========================================
          
          PROJECT OVERVIEW:
          This demonstrates the transformation of manual network 
          configuration into automated deployment using industry-standard tools.
          
          AUTOMATION BENEFITS:
          ✓ Consistency: Zero configuration errors
          ✓ Speed: Minutes vs hours of manual work  
          ✓ Scalability: Same automation works for 10 or 1000 devices
          ✓ Documentation: Complete audit trail of all changes
          ✓ Repeatability: Identical results every time
          
          TOOLS DEMONSTRATED:
          - Python: Network automation orchestration
          - Ansible: Configuration management
          - YAML: Human-readable configuration files
          - GNS3: Virtual network simulation
          - Git: Version control for network configs
          
          ACADEMIC VALUE:
          This project demonstrates modern DevOps practices
          applied to network engineering, showing real-world
          skills applicable in enterprise environments.
